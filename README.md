# Prime Number Checker
Checks if given input (number) is prime or not.

Very simple Python program. I got this for my practical exam where we had to choose a serial at random and had to perform whatever question was assigned to that serial. It operates on a simple basis which is taking and storing a number as "n", then checking divisibility inside a for loop and returning the value as prime or non-prime.

Flags can also be utilised for this project but I prefer to keep it simple.
